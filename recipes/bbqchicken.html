                <p>Barbecue chicken consist of chicken parts of entire chickens that are barbecued, grilled or smoked. There are many global and regional preparation techniques and cooking styles.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
                    <li>2 pounds cut up chicken pieces</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat grill to medium heat.</li>
                    <li>In a small skillet combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and put over low heat. Add the poultry seasoning while stirring constantly; when sauce mixes well and starts to bubble, it is done.</li>
                    <li>Place chicken on hot grill and brush with sauce. Grill for 45 to 60 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, and brush chicken with sauce after each turning. Grill until chicken is done and juices run clear. (Note: Be sure to keep an eye on the chicken as it cooks, as it tends to have flair ups due to the oil and chicken drippings!)</li>
